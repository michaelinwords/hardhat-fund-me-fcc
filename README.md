# HARDHAT FUND ME - FREE CODE CAMP TUTORIAL

## Notes:
- We can run "yarn hardhat deploy --tags mocks" to only deploy scripts which are tagged with "mocks"; we tag a script by defining its tags in module.exports.tags = []
- Every time we run a node with "yarn hardhat node" now, it will automatically have our deployed contracts running on it
